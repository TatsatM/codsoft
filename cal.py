    """In this line, we are iterating through all the children of the root window using root.winfo_children(). 
       This method returns a list of all the widgets (buttons, entry field, etc.) that are direct children of the root 
       window.

        The "bind" method is used to associate an event with a function. Here, we are binding the left mouse button
        click event to the on_click function for all the buttons in the application.

        "<Button-1>" is the event string for the left mouse button click event. In Tkinter, mouse events are represented 
        using event strings. Here are some common event strings for mouse-related events:
        <Button-1>: Left mouse button click
        <Button-2>: Middle mouse button click
        <Button-3>: Right mouse button click
        <Double-Button-1>: Left mouse button double-click"""
